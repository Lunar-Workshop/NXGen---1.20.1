Things got messy here (Had a lot of issues I ran into a lot of things got rapidly itterated on i had to go back and fix previous install ive kept a log)

Removed connector Extra - Incompatible with better combat ,Corpses causing a lot of issues with forge mods

Updated forge fabric api to fix issues (Likely cause of previous fabric mods not working will need to re review mods previously not working such as campfire seems like GD launcher panicked and grabbed wrong version wasnt picked up during audit
)


Installed better combat figured i best download one of the RPG mods to check its working all correcly chaos ensues I have no idea what downloaded with what as at this time i was also fixing the above
